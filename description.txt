This is a port of 	version 1.4.2.101 of the Calamity Mod, now playable on the modern version of tModLoader! Major highlights of this update consist of Rare Item Variants and unique items added to all Calamity shrines, also included however are early revisions of the Sunken Sea and reworked Astral Infection, in addition to the Siren's previous design, also known as Nahlyn.

Suggestions and bug reports will probably not be taken as to keep the version as true as possible, unless it's to fix an error/inconsistency that occurred during porting.
